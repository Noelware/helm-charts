## Ways on contributing
### Bug Reporting
If you find any bugs while running the Helm Charts, please create an issue with the `bug` label.

Before you find bugs you can nitpick on, please follow our guidelines before doing so:

- Be clear and concise with the title, it will help others link their issues and solutions to yours.
- Specify the ways to reproduce the bug, so our development team and contributors can reproduce by themselves.
- Show the output, using logs and screenshots, to help others understand your issue.
- Include the Kubernetes, Helm, Helm Chart, and App version in your issue, so we know what to look for.

### Security Issues
If you find a security issue, please contact us at **security@noelware.org** and we will work with you to report the issue.
